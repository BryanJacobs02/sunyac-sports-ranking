# Sports Rankings Using a Minimum Violations Method
*Final project for [MATH 332: Linear Programming and Operations Research](https://bulletin.geneseo.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=16&coid=20422) — SUNY Geneseo*
  
  
## Project Intro/Objective
This project applied the Minimum Violations Ranking (MVR) method to rank the 2023 SUNYAC Men’s Soccer teams based on their point differential matrix. The goal was to minimize inconsistencies in the ranking, accounting for both input and output ties. Through rearranging the matrix into hillside form, we identified weak wins and upsets, ultimately determining the final rankings. The analysis revealed that Cortland, Brockport, and Oneonta were the top three teams. Further work could involve scaling the MVR method to larger datasets, conducting sensitivity analysis, and comparing these rankings to official ones or other ranking methods.
